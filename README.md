# What is this?
An interactive character sheet for the Habitually Underbuilt Roleplay Integrated System, or HUBRIS, created by Nadav Elata with contributions and documentation (mostly) by El Hudson.

# Wait, arent there a bunch of TTRPG systems out there already?
Short answer: yes, but we're extra. Long answer: we wanted to build something that replicated the things we liked about D&D 5e, but also allowed for greater character diversity and more focus on creative problem-solving both inside and outside of combat. 

# Why do you need a whole website for it?
Right now HUBRIS lives in a bunch of different Google docs and a only-sort-of-maintained Notion page. We want to make it legible to people who aren't us, since this system was designed to replace our regular gaming group's reliance on 5e.
